1. Why do you think companies analyze large volumes of data?
Companies analyze large amounts of data to see the bigger picture of market trends and how they change over time. This helps them understand customer behavior, identify where demand is high, and see what the market is missing. Using this information, companies can make better business decisions and plan effective strategies for the future.

2. If analyzing and sorting large data manually in Excel is difficult, how do you think Python can help solve this problem?
I think Python can be more useful when it comes to big datasets. In Excel, it is more problamatic to work with large databases as it has a limitation for how much data can be inserted, while in Python this can be barely a problem.Besides,the process of analyzing and sorting large volumes of data can be automated, which is slow and difficult process in Excel.

3. Imagine you work at a sales company that receives data about 10,000 customer transactions daily. How would you analyze this data?
I would store the transactions in a database and analyze them using SQL. The data would be cleaned by removing duplicates and fixing errors, then categorized by product, customer, and transaction amount. I would automate this process to run daily and analyze trends such as top-selling products and customer behavior. Finally, I would visualize the results and create daily or monthly reports to support business decisions.

4. In your opinion, what tasks can Python be useful for in BI processes? (e.g., data cleaning, visualization, etc.)
I guess Python could be very useful automating data cleaning process,handling large datasets, and combining data from different sources.

5. If you wanted to compare a company's profit year by year, how could this be done using Python?
I would collect the company’s profit data for each year and load it into Python. Then I would compare the profits year by year to see how much they changed and calculate the growth rate for each year. I would also identify the years with the highest and lowest profits and analyze overall trends.

6. If you don't know Python, what difficulties might you face when working with large datasets?
If I didn’t know Python, handling large datasets would take me longer and be harder. I’d have to use tools like Excel, which have size limits and can cause manual mistakes. Cleaning data, removing duplicates, and repeating analyses would take a lot of time. It would also be tougher for me to automate tasks, do complex analyses, and work well with very large datasets or several data sources.
