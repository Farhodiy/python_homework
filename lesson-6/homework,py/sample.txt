Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system.
It is particularly useful in handling structured data, data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. 
Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. 
Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, with or without an index.
